Project Proposal - INFO-I 400

PROJECT IDEA: Using the backbone code from CSCI-C343's IU "street-view" project
that utilized Flickr to store and retrieve photos we plan to create an application
that illustrates differing definitions of technology around the world.

DETAILS: Photo data will be retrieved from Flickr (and possibly Facebook if more are needed).
Once the photo data is retrieved it will be sorted, partitioned, and cached for later use.
The photos will be grouped by country or region (as appropriate). The display of the 
application will be a world-view google map. On top of the map, icons for each photo grouping
will be placed. When the user hovers over an icon, a window will open showing a scrollable grid
containing all of the photos condensed to that region.

GOALS:
