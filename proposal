Project Proposal - INFO-I 400
Prof. Rawlins

STUDENTS: 
* Ross Larson (relarson)
* Brett Poirier (bpoirier)
			 
PROJECT IDEA: 
Using the backbone code from CSCI-C343's IU "street-view" project that 
utilized Flickr to store and retrieve photos we plan to create an application
that illustrates differing definitions of technology around the world.

GOAL:
To demonstrate any possible difference in the definition of technology across different
countries, regions, or cultures. Hopefully this demonstration will be through a simply
pictoral representation.

DETAILS: 
Photo data will be retrieved from Flickr (and possibly Facebook if more are needed).
Once the photo data is retrieved it will be sorted, partitioned, and cached for later use.
The photos will be grouped by country or region (as appropriate). The display of the 
application will be a world-view google map. On top of the map, icons for each photo grouping
will be placed. When the user hovers over an icon, a window will open showing a scrollable grid
containing all of the photos condensed to that region.

APIs TO BE USED:
* Flcikr REST API - photos
* Google Maps API - map
* Facebook API - photos
	* (only if needed)
	
LANGUAGE(s) TO BE USED:
* Java - for programming
* XML - for data retreaval

COLLABORATION TOOLS
* Eclipse IDE
* EGit Eclipse add-in
* Github Public repo
